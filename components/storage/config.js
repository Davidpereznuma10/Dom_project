                      "Panic! at the Disco was formed in 2004 in the suburban area of Summerlin, Las Vegas,by childhood friends Ryan Ross, who sang and played guitar, and Spencer Smith, who played drums.they began playing music together in ninth grade.They invited friend Brent Wilson  and Wilson invited classmate Brendon Urie to try out on guitar.Ross initially was the lead singer for the group, but after hearing Urie sing back-up during rehearsals, the group decided to make him the lead. Initially, Panic! at the Disco was a Blink-182 cover band. The four left their educations behind to concentrate on music; Ross had a falling-out with his father when he dropped out of college, and when Urie dropped out of high school, his parents kicked him out of the house.Ross and Urie sent a demo to Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz via a LiveJournal account. Wentz,who was in Los Angeles at the time with the rest of Fall Out Boy working on the band's major-label debut, Wentz was impressed and immediately wanted the band to sign to his Fueled by Ramen imprint label Decaydance Records, which made the band the first on the new label. in the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards Wentz said. 'Their record is going to be your next favorite record. It's called A Fever You Can't Sweat Out – get it before your little brother does.'",

                      "The band relocated to College Park, Maryland, to record its debut album from June to September 2005.lthough they only had shells of songs when they arrived, the rest of the album shaped up fast through the marathon session.'We were making things up in our heads that weren't there, and on top of the stress of trying to finish the record, we were living in a one-bedroom apartment with four people on bunk beds,' recalled Ross. 'Everyone got on everybody's nerves. Someone would write a new part for a song and someone else would say they didn't like it just because you ate their cereal that morning.'.\nThe album is split into two halves: the first half is mostly electronic dance punk, while the second half features Vaudevillian piano, strings, and accordion.'y the end of that, we were completely exhausted,'said Ross of the studio sessions. After its completion, 'we had two weeks to come home and learn how to be a band,' Ross said.The group played its first live show during the summer of 2005 at local Las Vegas music venue The Alley on West Charleston.\nThe band's debut album, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, was released September 27, 2005.Sales began relatively slow. It debuted at No. 112 on the Billboard 200 album chart,Panic! would release the video for its first single, 'I Write Sins Not Tragedies', rocket up the Billboard Hot 100 as sales of Fever passed the 500,000 mark.By August, the group's debut record was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and the music video for 'I Write Sins Not Tragedies' won Video of the Year at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards.\nOn May 17, 2006, Panic! at the Disco announced that original bassist Brent Wilson had left the band,He was replaced in the band by Jon Walker.\nIn June, the group headlined its first unnamed national tour, that would last until August.During the group's performance at the 2006 Reading Festival in August, the band was greeted by excessive bottling, one of which hit Urie in the face that knocked him unconscious. Despite this, the band continued with its set after Urie recovered.The Nothing Rhymes with Circus Tour feature the band's first highly theatrical live shows, which featured every song with dance numbers, skits, and tricks performed by a six-member troupe, as the band donned intricate costumes, loosely re-enacting moments from the songs.",

                      "In March 2007, after a short period of development regarding the ideas of the album, the band arrived at a cabin in the rural mountains of Mount Charleston, Nevada and began the writing process for the new album, Cricket & Clover.The band grew uninterested in the songs previously written and by August scrapped the entire new album 'We wanted to approach these songs in the most basic form,' Ross said. 'We wrote them all on one acoustic guitar and with someone singing. I think that we kind of skipped that part of songwriting on the first record, and this time we're sort of paying attention to that. […] We've written a bunch of songs since we've been home [Las Vegas]. I think it's the most fun and the happiest we've been since we started.'\nIn January 2008, the band unveiled a new logo and dropped the exclamation point from the group's name, becoming Panic at the Disco.Released on March 21, 2008, Pretty. Odd. was described by the band as 'more organic and mellower' than A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, as well as unintentionally and coincidentally similar to music of the Beatles, in both songwriting and scope.The record debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart, with first-day sales of 54,000, and first-week sales of 139,000 copies in the United States.The record also debuted at Current Alternative Albums chart and No. 2 on the Digital Albums chart, the latter of which accounted for 26 percent of the disc's overall sales.The album charted high in various other countries and was eventually certified gold in the United Kingdom, however, Pretty. Odd. received relatively disappointing sales in the face of its predecessor.\nThe band announced plans to headline the 2008 Honda Civic Tour in January 2008,which performed across North America from April 10 to July 14, 2008 .Throughout October and November 2008, the band toured with Dashboard Confessional and the Cab on the Rock Band Live Tour promoting the video game Rock Band 2.\nPretty. Odd.'s touring was also defined by a larger effort to remain environmentally conscious. On the tour, the band worked with two non-profit eco organizations: Reverb, which facilitates environmentally friendly touring; and Global Inheritance, which seeks to inspire more eco-activism.",

During the recording of the album, touring guitarist Ian Crawford, who joined the band in 2009 after the departure of Ryan Ross and Jon Walker, left the band citing his desire to make 'real, genuine' music. On July 15, 2013, the album was announced as Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!, with a scheduled release date of October 8, 2013.The first single, 'Miss Jackson,' was released on July 15, 2013, along with its music video to promote the album.\nShortly before the band began its first tour in support of the album, Smith wrote an open letter to fans regarding his abuse of alcohol and prescription medications since the recording of Pretty. Odd. Although Smith joined the band for the first handful of dates, he left the tour to 'continue fighting addiction.' Urie posted on the band's official website on August 7, 2013, that 'It's become evident that Spencer still needs more time to take care of himself. I can't expect him to be fighting addiction one minute and be fully immersed in a national tour the next. With that said, the tour will continue without Spencer while he is away getting the help he needs.'\nIn an interview with Pure Fresh on September 23, 2014, Urie stated that he had already thought about ideas on the fifth studio album; however, he was not sure if it would be a Panic! at the Disco album, or a solo album. Urie also stated there were no plans for Smith to return to the band.",
